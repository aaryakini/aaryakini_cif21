		<h1>about</h1>

		<p>The intention behind this project is to document the trash generated in my dorm room as relics of my roommates and I's lifestyles. I would like to prompt us as well as the viewer to ask ourselves questions of what can be observed by documenting what we choose to throw away. What kind of lifestyles do we lead? What do we consume most often? What do we prioritise? By displaying a weekâ€™s worth of trash as if they are relics to be preserved in a museum, I intend to inspire reflection on and hopefully action in response to these questions.

		The trash pictured in the site has been photoshopped to not only increase their visual intrigue so as to capture the eye of the viewer as might occur in a museum, as well as to enhance and emphasise their grotesque nature. The gold frames I have used for each piece of trash was found online.</p>
