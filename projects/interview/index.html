	<!-- QUESTIONS -->

	<p class="question">Do you use social media platforms often? If so, which ones do you use the most?</p>
	<p class="response">I would say that I use social media a lot and the main ones are Instagram and WhatsApp and TikTok.</p>

	<p class="question">What do you primarily use social media for?</p>
	<p class="response">The primary reason is communication. As I live far away from home, I used social media platforms to stay connected with my friends and family. But I also use them for finding recipes or getting inspiration from others.</p>

	<p class="question">Do you think that the ways in which you use social media is changing your perception of yourself?</p>
	<p class="response">It used to in the past. I remember following a lot of Instagram models, and I would always compare myself to them. I would also get very insecure. But later I realized that and unfollowed them, so right now it’s my friends and useful information.</p>

	<p class="question">Does it make you set any expectations that you otherwise wouldn’t have of yourself?</p>
	<p class="response">I think that it sets some expectations, but they are not always bad. For instance, I may look at a successful person and set some expectations for myself to also become successful in the future, and if you think about it, in this case it works as a motivational tool. But, of course, there are other things that made me set expectations of the body or the face that I should have. I don’t think that it is only due to social media, but it is one of the main factors that influences that.</p>

	<p class="question">Is it changing how you perceive and interact with others? If so, how?</p>
	<p class="response">I would say no.</p>

	<p class="question">Do you think you make judgments about others based on their social media presence? Does it tell you something about an individual's personality if they don’t use social media?</p>
	<p class="response">I wouldn’t say that I make judgements, but I still pay attention to some details, as I feel like you can find out some basic things about the person. However, I prefer to make judgments when I meet a person in real life. I also think that people who don’t use social media are brave and courageous.</p>

	<p class="question">What is your opinion on influencer culture? Do you think that “influencers” have the best interests of their followers in mind?</p>
	<p class="response">I think that influencer culture can be viewed from different points of view – negative and positive. It can be negative as sometimes it can promote unhealthy body image or spread false information. Due to the high number of followers it leads to a big scale problem. But on the other hand, this can also be turned another way around as some influencers can provide their followers with positive and useful information.</p>

	<p class="question">Do you think that social media can be used as a tool for something beyond social engagement?</p>
	<p class="response">I think it can. As I mentioned earlier, I think that if those “influencers” promote or share useful information, there could be some change. </p>

	<p class="question">Are there any disadvantages to using social media? Do you think it serves the greater good?</p>
	<p class="response">There are. One of them is propaganda of false information. I think it is both political and social. Social in terms of how it affects various aspects of someone’s life. I also believe that it may be changed only if both influencers and the followers change the way they give out or take in the information, as it is important to have a critical approach.</p>

	<p class="question">Will you ever stop using social media?</p>
	<p class="response">I don’t think so, mainly due to communication.</p>
