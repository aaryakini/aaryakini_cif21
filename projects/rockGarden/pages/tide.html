				<p class="space">These pods are high in demand around 65 Fifth Ave and thus a rare commodity to come by. Unlike back home, laundry also costs money here so each cent and thus each pod is precious. This bag served us diligently for two months before only a single pod was left. The pod has been preserved for a load of laundry small enough to deserve a smaller serving of detergent, but the plastic packaging unfortunately had to be disposed of due to concerns of space.</p>
